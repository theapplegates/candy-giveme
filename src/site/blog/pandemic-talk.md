So a pandemic is something you don't see everyday. Keep up to date with reliable information. 

COVID-19 is here in Cincinnati. The shelves are empty in the grocery stores. Most businesses are closed. The feeling is very apocalyptic. I understand why it needs to be done though. Here is a link to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 [informational page](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). The [map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) is interesting. Scary stuff.
