My [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com) frustrations began when I deleted my wife's email and a minute later re-created it with the same name. I can do this because I have a hosted email with Google. An actual business account back in the days when they wanted beta testers to their hosted email. I got two domains and they both use the service. My wife was on my Google Fi account and it turns out you can't mess with your email and not expect your Google Fi account to suddenly vanish.
 I went online to chat with a Google Fi representative and was told since my email domain was a business account the Google Fi service to her was cut off. I was shocked, and I said what the heck do you mean. Why would an email address which anyone can change at will effect her Google Fi account? They said each account was tied to an email account, not a phone number.
 I'll cut this short but after a month and a half countless emails and chats and purchasing a new SIM card my wife has her old number back. Not much fun Google.
